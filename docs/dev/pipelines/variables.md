# Variables

You can use expressions to programmatically set variables in workflow files and
access contexts. An expression can be any combination of literal values,
references to a context, or functions. You can combine literals, context
references, and functions using operators.

## Context

Contexts are a way to access information about workflow runs, runner
environments, jobs, and steps. Contexts use the following syntax.

::: v-pre
`${{ <context> }}`
